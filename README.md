### Overview  
In the pharmacy sector of the healthcare industry, ensuring billing accuracy is critical not only for maintaining financial health but also for adhering to regulatory standards. Inefficiencies and errors in billing processes—such as incorrect charges, missing data, or inconsistent entries—can result in significant financial losses, non-compliance risks, and reduced patient trust.

### Objective  
This project establishes a structured workflow to audit and analyze billing data within the healthcare and pharmacy domain. By applying data validation techniques and leveraging data visualization, the aim is to:

- Enhance data quality and accuracy  
- Detect anomalies and discrepancies in billing records  
- Uncover trends and patterns in billing behavior  
- Support decision-makers with clear, actionable insights

### Value Proposition  
A reliable billing audit framework minimizes errors, strengthens compliance, and improves operational transparency. Through this data-driven approach, healthcare providers can boost revenue integrity, reduce audit risks, and ultimately deliver a better experience for both patients and administrative stakeholders.

## Project Tasks

### 1. Data Collection
- Load the sample dataset or generate a representative synthetic dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and standardization to ensure consistency and usability.

### 2. Data Validation
- Assess the accuracy and completeness of the dataset.
- Identify and address missing values, invalid entries, or inconsistent records.

### 3. Billing Data Analysis
- Evaluate billing records for accuracy and processing timelines.
- Detect anomalies or discrepancies in billing behavior.
- Analyze key performance metrics, including:
  - Billing cycle duration
  - Discrepancies in payment amounts
  - Frequency of late payments
  - Average billed and paid amounts

### 4. Report Generation
- Produce a comprehensive billing audit report.
- Highlight key findings, trends, and issues uncovered in the analysis.
- Provide an overall assessment of the billing process’s accuracy and efficiency.
- Automate report generation as a repeatable step within the data pipeline.
